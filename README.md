# OCAML

## Installation

```bash
brew install opam
brew install curl # this was necessary for me otherwise `opam init -y' would fail
opam init -y
eval $(opam env)
```

This was the installation error before running `brew install curl`:
```
ERROR] Could not update repository "default": OpamDownload.Download_fail(_, "Download command failed: \"/opt/homebrew/bin/wget --content-disposition -t 3 -O

```

`opam switch` should now display something similar to:

```bash
#  switch   compiler     description
â†’  default  ocaml.5.1.1  default
```
